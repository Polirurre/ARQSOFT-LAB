After that, create a Main class and insert there the main() method. Its execution has to perform the following tasks:

    1. Create an object Computation for evaluating the expression: 15 + 5
    2. Evaluate this Computation object and present the result
    3. Create an object Computation for evaluating the expression: 20 + 10
    4. Evaluate this Computation object and present the result
